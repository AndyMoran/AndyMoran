# Andrew Moran — Data Scientist

Clear communication • Principled modelling • Uncertainty‑aware decision‑making

I build probabilistic models that behave well, converge reliably, and communicate uncertainty clearly. My work combines Bayesian inference, simulation, and structured narrative design to turn complex, messy data into decision‑ready insights. I’m especially interested in modelling uncertainty in energy systems, where risk, variability, and long‑horizon planning matter.

My portfolio follows a consistent professional workflow:

- Model justification

- Convergence diagnostics (r̂, ESS, divergences, trace/energy plots)

- Posterior predictive checks

- Model comparison

- Feature engineering rationale

- Business relevance

- Lessons learned

- Literature integration

This structure ensures transparency, reproducibility, and trustworthiness — the qualities that matter in real‑world modelling.

# Current Focus

I’m building a curated, professional portfolio that reflects both my formal training and my independent analytical interests. My work emphasises:

- clean, readable analysis

- principled statistical reasoning

- reproducible workflows

- uncertainty‑aware modelling

- clear narrative structure

- decision‑ready insights

I’m now extending these skills into energy‑sector forecasting, risk modelling, and probabilistic optimisation.

# Featured Projects

## VAR and Premier League Home Advantage: A Bayesian AnalysisTechniques: Bayesian modelling, sensitivity analysis, segmentation, causal reasoning

Focus: Evaluating VAR’s impact on competitive balance
Repo: https://github.com/AndyMoran/var_home_advantage_bayesian_analysis

A Bayesian investigation into whether VAR changed home advantage. Includes a full convergence section, PPCs, model justification, and a Big Six vs others segmentation. Sensitivity analysis shows that pandemic crowd‑effects, not VAR, explain most of the apparent shift.

Demonstrates:

- principled Bayesian inference

- sensitivity analysis to identify confounding

- segmentation for competitive‑balance evaluation

- translating statistical findings into business‑ready insights

## Cyclistic Bayesian Pricing & Behaviour Simulation

Techniques: Monte Carlo simulation, Bayesian decision‑making, scenario analysis
Focus: Pricing strategy under uncertainty
Repo: https://github.com/AndyMoran/Cyclistic_bayesian_analysis

A simulation‑based pricing model exploring how fare changes affect rider behaviour and revenue. Includes full convergence diagnostics, PPCs, and a clear justification for the modelling structure. Quantifies risk, identifies robust strategies, and supports policy decisions.

Demonstrates:

- simulation‑based decision‑making

- modelling behavioural uncertainty

- evaluating pricing trade‑offs probabilistically

## Falcon 9 Bayesian Reliability Analysis

Techniques: Bayesian logistic regression, calibration, validation
Focus: Engineering reliability & economic decision‑making
Repo: https://github.com/AndyMoran/falcon9-bayesian-reliability-analysis

A Bayesian model estimating Falcon 9 booster landing reliability across missions, pads, and rocket versions. Includes full convergence diagnostics, posterior predictive checks, and calibration/ROC validation. Extends into expected‑value economics to quantify the financial return of reusability under uncertainty.

Demonstrates:

- hierarchical reliability modelling

- uncertainty‑aware engineering decisions

- combining inference with economic reasoning

## Bellabeat Bayesian Activity Modelling

Techniques: Gamma likelihood, Fourier circadian modelling, hierarchical structure
Focus: Behavioural segmentation & personalised engagement
Repo: https://github.com/AndyMoran/bellabeat_bayesian_analysis

A hierarchical Gamma/Fourier model capturing 24‑hour activity rhythms across Bellabeat personas. Includes model comparison (WAIC/LOO), full diagnostics, and literature integration on circadian modelling. Uses probability‑of‑superiority to compare personas hour‑by‑hour.

Demonstrates:

- modelling cyclic behaviour with Fourier series

- principled handling of right‑skewed data

- uncertainty‑aware behavioural comparison
