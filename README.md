# Hi, I'm Andrew 👋

I'm a data analyst and data scientist who focuses on clear communication, thoughtful modelling, and well‑structured analytical work. I enjoy taking messy data, organising it with intention, and producing insights that are both technically sound and easy to understand.

## 🔭 Current Focus

I'm building a curated, professional portfolio that reflects both my formal training and my independent analytical interests. My work emphasises:

- clean, readable analysis  
- principled statistical reasoning  
- reproducible workflows  
- clear narrative structure

## 📂 Featured Projects

### **Falcon 9 Bayesian Reliability Analysis**
A hierarchical Bayesian model of Falcon 9 booster landing reliability, combining logistic regression, mission‑level random effects, and expected‑value economics to quantify the financial impact of reusability.
**Repo:** https://github.com/AndyMoran/falcon9-bayesian-reliability-analysis

### **Bellabeat Bayesian Analysis**
A hierarchical Gamma/Fourier Bayesian model of circadian activity patterns across Bellabeat personas, capturing smooth 24‑hour rhythms, uncertainty‑aware behavioural differences, and hour‑by‑hour probability‑of‑superiority.
**Repo:** https://github.com/AndyMoran/bellabeat_bayesian_analysis

### **Cyclistic Bayesian Analysis**
A Bayesian decision‑making project using Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate pricing strategy under uncertainty, modelling rider behaviour, revenue trade‑offs, and scenario‑based policy outcomes.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/AndyMoran/Cyclistic_bayesian_analysis

### **Learning Portfolio (Completed Courses)**
A structured collection of projects from the Google Data Analytics and IBM Data Science programmes.  
Each project is organised, documented, and cleaned for clarity.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/AndyMoran/learning-portfolio
