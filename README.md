# Hi, I'm Andrew 👋

I'm a data analyst and scinetist who a focuses on clear communication, thoughtful modelling, and well‑structured analytical work. I enjoy taking messy data, organising it with intention, and producing insights that are both technically sound and easy to understand.

## 🔭 Current Focus

I'm building a curated, professional portfolio that reflects both my formal training and my independent analytical interests. My work emphasises:

- clean, readable analysis  
- principled statistical reasoning  
- reproducible workflows  
- clear narrative structure
