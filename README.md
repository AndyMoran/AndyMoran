# Andrew Moran — Data Analyst & Data Scientist

**Clear communication** • **Principled modelling** • **Reproducible analysis**

I specialise in building analytical work that is structured, interpretable, and grounded in sound statistical reasoning. My projects combine Bayesian modelling, simulation, and thoughtful narrative design to turn complex data into clear, decision‑ready insights.

This portfolio brings together my exemplar projects — each chosen to demonstrate a different modelling skillset and analytical approach.

## 🔭 Current Focus

I’m building a curated, professional portfolio that reflects both my formal training and my independent analytical interests. My work emphasises:

- clean, readable analysis  
- principled statistical reasoning  
- reproducible workflows  
- clear narrative structure  
- decision‑ready insights

## 📂 Featured Projects

### Falcon 9 Bayesian Reliability Analysis

Techniques: Hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression, mission‑level random effects, expected‑value economics
Focus: Engineering reliability & economic decision‑making
Repo: https://github.com/AndyMoran/falcon9-bayesian-reliability-analysis

A hierarchical Bayesian model estimating Falcon 9 booster landing reliability across missions, pads, and rocket versions. The analysis incorporates mission‑level random effects and posterior predictive checks, then extends into expected‑value economics to quantify the financial return of reusability under uncertainty.

This project demonstrates:

- modelling reliability with hierarchical structure

- uncertainty‑aware engineering decision‑making

- combining statistical inference with economic reasoning

### Bellabeat Bayesian Activity Modelling

Techniques: Gamma likelihood, Fourier circadian modelling, hierarchical structure, probability‑of‑superiority
Focus: Behavioural segmentation & personalised engagement
Repo: https://github.com/AndyMoran/bellabeat_bayesian_analysis

A hierarchical Gamma/Fourier Bayesian model capturing 24‑hour activity rhythms across Bellabeat personas. The model replaces unstable lookup‑table approaches with smooth Fourier components, incorporates user‑level random intercepts, and uses probability‑of‑superiority to compare personas hour‑by‑hour.

This project demonstrates:

- modelling cyclic behaviour with Fourier series

- principled handling of right‑skewed data

- uncertainty‑aware behavioural comparison

- translating statistical output into product insights

### Cyclistic Bayesian Pricing & Behaviour Simulation

Techniques: Monte Carlo simulation, Bayesian decision‑making, scenario analysis
Focus: Pricing strategy under uncertainty
Repo: https://github.com/AndyMoran/Cyclistic_bayesian_analysis

A scenario‑based pricing analysis using Bayesian reasoning and Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate how pricing changes affect rider behaviour and revenue. The project simulates thousands of pricing outcomes to quantify risk, identify robust strategies, and support policy decisions.

This project demonstrates:

- simulation‑based decision‑making

- modelling behavioural uncertainty

- evaluating pricing trade‑offs with probabilistic thinking
